# Summary

### 🧩 Problem

There was no systematic way to simultaneously assess the quality of two sources which directly impact the reliability of biomedical research.

### 🔍 Approach & Workflow

<img src="figures/Figure1.jpg" alt="Collected data structure and systematic workflow" width="700"/>

To address this problem, we design <br>   **Four different processes for selecting indexes that can be evaluated for relative quality**   
   
🟥 **Process Red**

20 indexes directly collected from 109 species  &nbsp;➔&nbsp;  Pre-processing &nbsp;➔&nbsp; EDA(Descriptive statistics, Group-wise comparison), Correlation analysis &nbsp;➔&nbsp; **3 indexes selected**

🟦 **Process Blue** 

37 indexes collected by pipeline on 3,420 samples &nbsp;➔&nbsp; Pre-processing &nbsp;➔&nbsp; Correlation analysis &nbsp;➔&nbsp; **3 indexes selected**

🟩 **Process Green** 

30 indexes directly collected from 102 species &nbsp;➔&nbsp; Pre-processing &nbsp;➔&nbsp; Dimensionality reduction, EDA, Correlation analysis &nbsp;➔&nbsp; **1 index selected**

🟨 **Process Yellow** 

14 indexes collected by pipeline on 3,420 samples &nbsp;➔&nbsp; Pre-processing &nbsp;➔&nbsp; EDA, Correlation analysis &nbsp;➔&nbsp; **3 indexes selected**

### 📈 Conclusion
A total of 10 selected indicators were directionally matched and integrated using a weighted arithmetic mean ▶ Development of novel quality assessment index
